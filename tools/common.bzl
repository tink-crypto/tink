""" Rule for simple expansion of template files. """

# Rule for simple expansion of template files. This performs a simple
# search over the template file for the keys in substitutions,
# and replaces them with the corresponding values.
#
# Borrowed from TensorFlow (https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow)
#
# Typical usage:
#   load("/tools/build_rules/template_rule", "expand_header_template")
#   template_rule(
#       name = "ExpandMyTemplate",
#       src = "my.template",
#       out = "my.txt",
#       substitutions = {
#         "$VAR1": "foo",
#         "$VAR2": "bar",
#       }
#   )
#
# Args:
#   name: The name of the rule.
#   template: The template file to expand
#   out: The destination of the expanded file
#   substitutions: A dictionary mapping strings to their substitutions
