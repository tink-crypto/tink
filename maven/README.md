# To publish snapshots of Tink and apps

```shell
./maven/publish-snapshot.sh
```

This command publishes latest snapshots to Maven, and their Javadocs to
https://google.github.com/tink.

Snapshots are also automatically published for every new commit to
the master branch of https://github.com/google/tink.
