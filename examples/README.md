# tink-examples

These examples show how to use [Tink](https://github.com/google/tink)
to perform common crypto tasks. They also show how to add a dependency
on Tink using Maven, Gradle or Bazel.

These examples share with Tink the same Bazel's WORKSPACE, thus their
BUILD files can directly depend on Tink. There are also other examples
in [the tink-examples repo](https://github.com/thaidn/tink-examples)
that show how to add Tink as a dependency using Bazel's maven_jar rule.
